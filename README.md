This project aim at creating a bridge between the Xiaomi Mijia Bluetooth BLE temperature & humidity sensor and an MQTT broker.

# Deprecated
I abandoned this project in favor of ESPHome https://esphome.io/ which simply let you create firmwares for ESP32 that support Mijia temperature sensors and publishing to MQTT !
